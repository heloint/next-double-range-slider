Custom range slider
===================

This Next.js project contains a range slider component with double thumbs on the **"/exercise1"** route.
The component by default is feeding from a mock route handler on the "/api/range-values/random" route to get random mock data.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development / production server on port **8080**:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm run build && npm run start
```

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
# or
npx jest
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
