Custom range slider
===================

This Next.js project contains a range slider component with double thumbs on the **"/exercise1"** route.
The component by default is feeding from a mock route handler on the "/api/range-values/normal" route to get normal use case mock data.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server on port **8080**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run dev && npm run test
```

To run in production adjust a .env file according to the ".env.local" as example, then:

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

**NOTE:** *To adjust the default port (8080), adjust the scripts commands in the package.json file*

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.
